Rick Budhwa came up the Skeena in the late ‘90s to work as an anthropologist for the office of the Wet’suwet’en, the First Nations group whose traditional territory ranges from Burns Lake in the east out to the coast range in the west. He was hired to look at how paleo-archaeological events—landslides, earthquakes, floods—are reflected in oral traditions. This work had implications in Canada’s legendary Delgamu’uk case–sixteen years of court proceedings that culminated in a landmark Supreme Court decision that gave First Nation oral traditions evidentiary weight in a court of law. 

Budhwa’s work supported the alignment of oral narratives with the geological and biological interpretation of ancient events. But it also affirmed that those traditions include include information about technology, ethics, morality, family histories, and protocols for how to live your life. 

Later, he worked as an anthropologist for the Land and Resources department within the Wet’suwet’en. “One of my great memories is hopping in a van for a ‘meeting’ with about six other people," he says. "We drove to a place close to a river and pulled over and walked into a cut block–an area that had been harvested for forestry. I was looking at them and they were looking everywhere else–looking down and looking up, looking all around. They were touching trees. They were just…being there. It was an amazing experience.”

Budwha is now the director of the Bulkley Valley Research Center in Smithers and is an anthropology professor at Northwest Community College.
