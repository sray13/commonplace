“When the pickups started to get outnumbered by the BMWs,” Monty Bassett says of his hometown, Jackson Hole, Wyoming, “I knew it was time to leave.” Monty, 65, moved to British Columbia in the 1970s seeking a more peaceful existence. He’s cleared land, run cattle, and raised five daughters with his wife on the Telkwa High Road above Smithers. Monty has also been involved in a number of advocacy campaigns in the region over the past thirty years and operates Out Yonder Productions, a documentary production company. His work has garnered awards and appeared on the Discovery Channel and History Channel, among others.
Monty spent five years documenting Tahltan communities through the events surrounding Shell’s plans for coalbed methane wells in the Sacred Headwaters. In 2005, he and videographer Taylor Fox filmed the arrest of 15 Tahltan elders after they blockaded the mining company Fortune Minerals.
Monty was first pulled into filmmaking in the mid-1980s when working on a script with cinematographer Myron Kozak on a project to stop industrialized clear-cut logging of the slow growing, northern boreal forests. Kozak was tragically killed in a bush plane accident midway through the project. With assistance from another editor, and narration by David Suzuki, Monty pulled together a 20-minute film called Cassiar at the Crossroads, which closed the Cassiar District to logging.
Monty’s eclectic jobs over the years have included serving as a mountain guide, ski instructor, journalist in South America, soldier, university instructor, Executive Director of a wildlife research foundation, and even a rodeo clown.
