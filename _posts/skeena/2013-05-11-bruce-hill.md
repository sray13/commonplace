A veteran of pretty well every major “environmentalist” battle in the Skeena Country over the past 30 years or so, Bruce Hill has had an eagle eye’s view of the struggles it took to bring the Skeena’s salmon runs back from the brink. He came into the country from the United States, mostly Michigan by way of Southern California, during the same northward hippie migration that brought Monty Bassett to the Bulkley Valley. He raised two kids with his wife Anne as a logger, small sawmill operator, and homesteader in the eastern reaches of the Wet’suwet’en territory. He came into his stride as a steelhead guide based mostly out of Terrace, quickly emerged as the loudest noise coming out of the Steelhead Society, and by the early 1990s he was heading up its Wild Steelhead Campaign, which was at the leading edge of the salmon wars that so transformed the Skeena fisheries for the better. He was also deeply involved in supporting the Haisla people in saving the Kitlope Valley from massive clearcut plans in the early 1990s.
