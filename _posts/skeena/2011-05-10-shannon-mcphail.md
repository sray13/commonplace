With lineage that goes back four generations in the Kispiox Valley region, Shannon McPhail grew up on a working ranch within the Skeena watershed, raised on a diet of mountain goat meat, moose, wild sheep, and fish.
She left for Calgary, seeking outlets for education and sports. But it was only a number of years before she and husband Steve left high-paying jobs in the city—she managed a fitness and nutrition center for women, and he worked as a welder—to move back to the Kispiox Valley, a place where the “community will rally together when needed.” 
As an editor of the local newspaper, McPhail, 37, was initially out to allay people of their fears of development—particularly Shell’s proposal to drill for coalbed methane in the headwaters region. But after learning about Shell’s refusal to hire local workers and the unstudied environmental effects of drilling, she eventually ended up as the director of the Skeena Watershed Conservation Coalition (SWCC) in Old Hazelton. In a joint project with Tahltan elders, the coalition set up a “Sacred Headwaters Witness Team” to prove that there were salmon returning high up in headwaters territory—right in the zone where development rights had been auctioned off.
