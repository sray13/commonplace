This magazine ends here. But the conversation is just beginning.

The world is pressing in and nobody is coming to our rescue. We are it. Hope is in our own ingenuity, our reverence for the past, our fierce sense of place. That’s the spirit that has buoyed the Skeena region, allowing people to hold onto a measure of self-determination against extreme odds. Again and again.

Are you part of the Skeena’s loosely organized “folkstorm”? Are you working on something new that builds on something old? Tell us what you are up to, why you do it, where you go from here.

How does one place remain intact and another doesn’t? North America is littered with eroded and wrecked salmon systems, while the Skeena holds up.

Are you working in a similar vein elsewhere in the world? What catches your eye about the Skeena, its struggles and its responses to globalization and development?
