_Editor’s note: Wade Davis’ piece here from his book_ The Sacred Headwaters _(Greystone and David Suzuki Foundation, 2011) centers around Ealue Lake, in the heart of the headwaters region that feeds the Stikine, Skeena, and Nass rivers and home to his longtime Native friends, Alex Jack and Oscar Dennis._

Oscar Dennis’s mother, Mary, once told me that the measure of a Tahltan was not the color of skin or the makeup of the blood but the manner in which a person treats the land. She shared this thought at a wake, as she and James buried a son. I think what Mary meant was that in a sense we all have a chance to be Tahltan, not by ethnicity or by co-opting a heritage that is so powerfully and uniquely theirs, but simply by expressing in spirit and commitment a loyalty to place.

When I first knew the Stikine, I attended a gathering at Iskut as the community rallied against BC Hydro’s plans to flood the Grand Canyon of a river that runs through the lives of every Tahltan man and woman. A young back-to-the-land hippie stood up and in what he took as a display of solidarity declared that if these dams got built he would just have to leave the country. Right after him a Tahltan youth rose and with immense dignity turned to the previous speaker and said, “Partner, that’s the difference between you and me. If they build these dams, I’ll still be here.”

For nearly thirty-five years, the Stikine has called me home, and for much of that time, ever since we bought our place at Wolf Creek, it has actually been home, even as my work has taken me throughout the world. The poet Gary Snyder, asked how a person could best protect the environment, replied, “Stay put.”

The moment that I knew the Iskut Valley would always cradle my family came late one evening in the summer of 2010. My younger daughter, Raina, had gone out on the lake in an old wooden canoe and had not returned by dark. Not a week before, several world-class kayakers just back from a successful descent of the Stikine canyon had flipped that very canoe, and I had fished them out on the verge of hypothermia. So I decided to take out a motor launch and see what had become of her.

Raina has a very special attachment to the lake and to all of the Stikine country. From the age of three, she had traveled the rivers with us, down the length of the Turnagain to the Kechika and the Liard, down the Taku from its headwaters at Sheslay past the Nahlin to the Inklin and Nakina and beyond to the sea. By seven she had been up and down the length of the Stikine and from our lodge had explored all the ridges from Todagin to Cold Fish and far beyond. At ten she eagerly guided guests up the trail to the summit of Sky Mountain, a faint track through the bush that intimidates many an adult client.

In the old days, Tahltan men and women often took in, and raised, children from other families; it was a natural adaptation for a hunting culture. Alex Jack never had his own kids, but he and Madeline brought up several nieces and nephews. But there was a strong sense that certain children would always remain by a parent’s side. Of Raina, Alex often said, “She’s the one gonna stay by you.”

When she was five, Raina disappeared from our property. I searched for several hours before finding her far up the creek, dressed in her favorite purple bonnet and work gloves, kneeling by a dead black bear cub as she tried to stroke it back to life. I immediately looked for the boar that had undoubtedly killed the cub and now, though she did not know it, threatened my daughter. When I later recounted the story to Alex, he took it as a sign, of what I was never sure.

It was a beautiful night, with bright stars overhead and a sliver of a moon in the eastern sky over Spatsizi. I hazarded a guess that Raina had gone to her favorite place on the lake, a rocky bluff directly across from our lodge. Sure enough, I found the old chestnut canoe tied up to a snag at the base of the game trail that skirts the trees and rises through the rocks to reach in a few minutes a promontory with a surprisingly expansive view across the lake. Although it is only perhaps a hundred feet above the water, the shift in perspective is quite dramatic. In daylight it causes our lodge to appear almost as a dream, nestled in the forest along the far shore, with the great flanks of the mountains rising behind.

Raina was sitting alone, staring out to the lake. When I reached her I saw that she had been crying, and when I asked the obvious question, she replied, “Daddy, this is my home. This is the vortex of my life. It is so beautiful. This is where I want to live and where I want to die.”

In that moment, even as engineers and drillers went about their business at the Red Chris site not three miles away from where we sat, I promised Raina that we would never abandon this country and that even if the mine went ahead, we would wait it out as a family, along with the families of our Tahltan friends in Iskut. I might not be around in thirty years to celebrate the return of silence to the lake, but she would be, along with her sister, Tara, and their children, and in time their children’s children.

This is what Mary Dennis meant, and what the elders have been saying all along. When company officials confronted the blockade in the summer of 2005 Mary swept them back into their vehicles with these words:

>>Great Spirit! Come on! Pray for our people, my children, my daughters, my sons, my grandchildren, my great-grandchildren. They’re crying because their hearts are broken. It’s tearing out. And also me. I’m speaking to the mining companies. I’m a Tahltan woman. I can go into the bush and cut my own wood and make my own campfire and set my own tent. I’m a hunter. I shot many moose and caribou. I’m a trapper. I skin whatever I catch. I live off of this land. I taught my children to live off of this land. We depend on this land. We must save it for our grandchildren. That’s why what I am doing today. And I will continue doing it as long as I’m here. I am proud to be who I am. _Meduh!_ Thank you.
