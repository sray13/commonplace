In Skeena country, the relationship between land and people goes back eons, to the time of the great mythical city at the center of the region: Dimlahamid.  Ancient forms of tenure and title radiate outward from Dimlahamid in every direction: rank, name, fishing station, goat-hunting mountain, hillside berry ground, crest. Every cranny and back eddy is accounted for. The Skeena is a wildness tended by people. And settlers are very much becoming part of the tradition, leaving behind their early moniker bestowed by natives: umshewa, or “driftwood.”
