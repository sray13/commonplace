It took fifteen seconds at the Cassiar Cannery for Mark Bell and Justine Crawford to get hooked. At what was once the largest cannery in British Columbia, situated on a channel right at the mouth of the Skeena, “we were running around like kids at recess, envisioning all the ways that the place could sustain us,” Crawford says. 

When the two returned title in hand, in August 2006, reality set in. “The whole thing—the actual site—was just a disaster,” Crawford says. “Cassiar stopped production in 1983, and it entered into twenty years of neglect.”  All of the buildings were crammed full of junk. The freezer building was foul with rust and dust and pigeon poop. Their first project was to clear the docks.  It took them eight or nine months, getting up every day, with a little help, mostly from family. They made a name for themselves by building a new cabin on a local’s 46-foot wooden troller. The owner, a guy named Jade Miner Steve, is well known around northern BC and lots of people looked at the cabin extension.  Their boat shop, Poseidon Marine, was born.

Bell and Crawford have expanded into tourism, restoring the old plant managers’ cottages into guesthouses. They are salvaging logs from the Skeena, descended from all over the watershed, for furniture. They figure Cassiar’s next primary industry is a premium, sustainable drinking water business. Salmon processing used large quantities of water and there’s a local system of creeks fed by rain and meltwater. Bell and Crawford hope it will provide an enduring, high value industry for the area.  

“We think of Cassiar Cannery as more than a site. It is essentially a small town. At its peak there were 1,000 people that lived here with up to 600 workers. Cassiar Cannery wants to go back to work,” says Crawford.
