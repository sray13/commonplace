*I. The Mountain Goats Invite the People to a Feast*

You can tell you’ve been closing in on the epicenter of Dimlahamid by the gradual ubiquity of hemlock and cedar along the main Yellowhead Highway as it unfurls westward through British Columbia, and by the snowy peaks of the looming mountains and the fireweed on the hillsides. You will swear you can smell the scent of salt air even though you’ve still got another three and a half hours to go before you’re at the coast. Everything is immediately and strangely discernible. You’re suddenly in the very middle of something very old and quiet, and at the edge of something very big and loud.

The roar of Hagwilget Canyon tells you that you are leaving the vast ranges of the Athapaskan language families, which reach all the way back to Hudson Bay, with linguistic cousins down among the Navajo and the Apache. These are the mountains and valleys of the people who call themselves Gitxsan, and they speak Gitxanimaax, which is the furthest upriver extent of several Tsimshian-related languages in a saltwater complex of tongues arising from Northern California and reaching all the way to Southeast Alaska. This is also where the old Roman Catholic influences of the continent begin to most noticeably bleed away into the Protestant missionary dominance of the coast that lies ahead. The Bulkley River boils through the canyon below you, emptying itself into the Skeena River just downstream, and up in the clouds above you is Mount Roche de Boule, which is Stegyawden.

By the time you’ve reached the little constellation of communities the locals today call the Hazeltons—New Hazelton, South Hazelton, Two Mile, Gitanmaax, Hagwilget, Old Town—everything gets impossibly jumbled and ragged. But this is also where everything starts to make perfect sense. This is where Dimlahamid was. They say it was like a vast city, a place that covered so much ground that a flock of geese could not traverse it without falling from the sky. Dimlahamid is where the world ends. Dimlahamid is where the world renews itself all over again.

Dimlahamid is where the story begins.

Up there in the peaks of Stegyawden, who knows how long ago, mountain goats once took the form of men. They invited the people of Dimlahamid to a great feast. It was a ruse to prepare for the avenging of an injustice that had been done to them by a group of young hunters years before. When everyone had settled down to the feast, a great one-horned goat appeared. The story ends with heaps of bodies at the foot of Stegyawden.

It’s a complicated story involving sacrilege and cruelty, but the thing to keep your eye on is that one young man was spared by the one-horned goat chief, and this man had been a boy when he’d spared the goat chief from slaughter years before. He’d marked the goat by rubbing its head in red ocher; that’s how he could tell it was the same goat. The moral of the story could be put this way: You do not want to mess with this place.

Pull in at a New Hazelton truck stop, and you can hear it in people’s voices. It’s the same back in Smithers as it is down at Prince Rupert. Ask about the place. People will start talking about the mountains, the salmon, or the forests, and right away in their voices you will notice a kind of inflection, something along the spectrum running from reverence to pride to melancholy. It’s not what you would call environmentalism. It’s gone beyond that now. Among the far-flung descendants of the people of Dimlahamid, so it is too now among the people who have only lately come to call the Skeena Country their home. White people are very much a part of it now. They’re not just *umshewa*, driftwood, anymore.

Everyone is connected. Everything is connected. Even if you add in the people of the Nass Valley to the north and the Kitimat Valley to the southwest and all the islands within a day’s sail of the Skeena estuary, there are still fewer than 100,000 people in the Skeena Country. Most people are clustered around the Hazeltons, Smithers, Terrace, and Prince Rupert.

More than anything else, the salmon connect everyone to one another as well as to the water and the land. The Skeena River is one of the most productive salmon watersheds in the world. After the Fraser Basin, it’s the second largest watershed in British Columbia. More than three hundred distinct spawning populations of all five species of salmon and steelhead breathe life into the Skeena’s eleven major tributary rivers, supporting a human economy worth more than $100 million annually in tribal, commercial, and recreational fisheries. The salmon form the currency among and between myriad species in the Skeena Country’s four main mountain ranges and seven distinct biogeoclimatic zones, from the upland boreal interior to the salt marshes of the coastal temperate rainforest. The salmon swim among and between everything, connecting the mountains to the sea and the future to the past.

Words like *ecosystem* might get you partway into understanding all this, but *wilderness* is where you’ll get lost. Every river confluence, every hillock, and every rock outcrop in the Skeena Country has its own story. 

![A Wet’suwet’en dipnetter works the Moricetown Canyon.Photo by Gary Fiegehen.]({{ ASSET_PATH }}skeena/img/Glavin/Moricetown20120731_006.jpg)

Ancient forms of tenure and title radiate outward from Dimlahamid in every direction: rank, name, fishing station, goat-hunting mountain, hillside berry ground, crest. Hawilamax is The Place They Throw Away Turnips. Anwaris is Place of Digging. There is a place called Angudoon, which is the short form for a name that translates more fully as The Steep Place on the Riverbank Where a Man Is Pulled Up with the Right Hand of a Friend. Every cranny and back eddy is accounted for in the deepest antiquity by means of matrilineal clan systems of ownership and succession, all codified in what the Gitxsan call *ada’ox*, and what their Bulkley River neighbors among the Wet’suwet’en call *kungax*, and replicated in similarly distinct ways among the Kitselas, the Kitsumkalum, the Gitxaala, the Metlakatla, the Nisga’a, the Haisla, and all the way out to the Gitga’at of Hartley Bay.

Each inch of ground is spoken for in intricate and often fiercely contested relationships among and between the people, the chiefs, and their clans. From as far into the northern interior as the eastern tributaries of Babine Lake, the crests of the house groups open a potlatch-box network of narrative trails, laws, obligations, and rights that spread like filaments in a web of family relations and ancient story-motif affinities, all the way to the outer coast. From the House of Many Eyes and the Birch Bark House around Moricetown, some event that may seem like a drizzle of rain if you’re just passing through will soon enough be noticed in tremors running through the Fireweed, Frog, Wolf, and Eagle clans, all the way out to the Killer Whale clan of Hartley Bay. Those people, way out there too, came from Dimlahamid.

In the second decade of the twenty-first century, that peculiar inflection that you’d sometimes hear in the people’s voices was most acutely evident when the subject turned to the tumults overtaking the Skeena Country. You’d find yourself in conversations that required resorting to terms like *ecological upheaval,* *catastrophic destruction*, and *malevolence.* Almost overnight, industrialization projects worth $40 billion were either awaiting approval or were approved and permitted or well under way in the Skeena Country. At whatever stage, they were shaking the ground from the Upper Iskut to the Kitimat and from Old Kuldo to the Estevan Islands. Nobody could remember anything quite like it.

It was like something straight out of Dimlahamid.

*II. The Return of the Medeek*

In the Gitxsan *ada’ox*, the Medeek is a great bear spirit that arises from the depths of Seeley Lake, which nowadays is only a pleasantly reed-choked fishing hole and campsite just off the Yellowhead Highway a few minutes west of New Hazelton. The saga of the Medeek takes some long while to tell properly. The bear spirit engages the chiefs of Dimlahamid in an epic battle, destroying everything in its path. There are earthquakes and avalanches. Mountainsides collapse. Forests are uprooted. Eventually, the monster is driven into the Skeena River. The creature’s malevolence makes its way back into the forest, and the creature itself is said to have returned to its lair at the bottom of Seeley Lake.

The Medeek is also a phenomenon known to geologists and paleoecologists as a mysterious event that occurred some 3,500 years ago in the Hazelton Mountains. There was an ecological cataclysm of some kind—rivers changing their courses, massive debris torrents. There was terrible destruction. The one important difference between back then and the early years of the twenty-first century is that this time around, nobody quite knows how the story is going to end. Even from the narrowest economic analysis, nothing like this had happened in the Skeena Country since the Grand Trunk Pacific Railroad, the brainchild of the eccentric magnate Charles Melville Hays, connected Winnipeg to Prince Rupert in 1914.

Just as the Atlantic replaced the Mediterranean as the main sea of commerce after the voyages of Christopher Columbus, so the Pacific replaced the Atlantic, by the twenty-first century, as the planet’s primary thoroughfare for trade and industrial expansion. With the phenomenal expansion of Asian economies, suddenly it was significant that the Port of Prince Rupert lay closer than other West Coast cities to key Asian ports, thirty-six hours closer to Shanghai than Vancouver and sixty-eight hours closer than Los Angeles. Prince Rupert connected to three continental railroad networks. Los Angeles connected to only two.

When Canada’s newly minted Conservative government set out to transform the country into an “energy superpower” in 2006, it wasn’t just loose talk. Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s government intended to leverage northwestern BC’s Pacific advantage to feed China’s ravenous appetite for commodities.

Oil would be the top—but by no means the only—commodity on the list. Canada’s crude oil reserves are estimated at 173 billion barrels, behind only Saudi Arabia and Venezuela in proven reserves. Almost all of Canada’s oil is locked up in bitumen, otherwise known as the tar sands. Canada’s National Energy Board reckoned bitumen production would triple over the first three decades of the twenty-first century. The Conservative government intended to exceed even those expectations. What this would require, by the spring of 2012, was the enactment of an unprecedented omnibus budget bill in the House of Commons that introduced, amended, or repealed nearly seventy federal laws, mostly related to environmental assessment and fisheries habitat protection, along with the abandonment of federal control on greenhouse gas emissions.

What all that was largely intended to accommodate was a plan by the pipeline builder Enbridge Inc. to construct a $5.5 billion, 1,172-kilometer double pipeline punched straight through the heart of the Skeena Country from Bruderheim, Alberta, to awaiting supertankers at Kitimat. The largely Beijing-backed enterprise anticipated the crossing of perhaps 1,000 salmon rivers and creeks between the Rocky Mountains and the coast. It would mean 225 oil tankers every year, carrying unprocessed bitumen to refineries in California and China, traversing the tide currents and narrow passages of British Columbia’s fabled Great Bear Rainforest, and then out into some of the most treacherous seas on earth.

And that wasn’t even the half of it.

*III. The Country of the Red Goats*

The place the Skeena River begins is roughly 600 kilometers upstream from saltwater on the western edges of the Spatsizi Plateau. Other creeks and streams flowing off Klappan Mountain go on to form the two other great undammed rivers of British Columbia’s northwestern quarter, the Nass and the Stikine. The territory is most closely associated with the Tahltan people, although the word *Spatsizi* derives from the Sekani term for “red goat,” which comes from the area’s plentiful mountain goats and their purported ages-past custom of adorning themselves in red ocher. Otherwise known as iron oxide, red ocher is used in the painting of pictographs and certain heraldic poles. It’s said to be something no self-respecting Nisga’a or Gitxsan medicine person would ever have been without. It is the thing the marked the head of the one-horned goat that invited the people of Dimlahamid to that feast all those years ago.

Because of its abundance of goats, grizzlies, moose, and wolves, and because it is home to the largest herd of Stone sheep in the world and the largest concentration of woodland caribou west of the Rocky Mountains, the region came to be called Canada’s Serengeti. Because it is where the Skeena, the Nass, and the Stikine arise, environmentalists call it the Sacred Headwaters. Because of all these things, an uproar greeted the news back in 2004 that Shell Canada Energy, a Royal Dutch Shell subsidiary, had moved into the territory.

Before the local regional district was even aware of it, Shell was already barreling ahead with plans to sink hundreds of wells to tap into coal-bed methane over an area of 4,000 square kilometers of the Klappan Range. The wells would require hundreds of roads and pipelines. The whole project was based on the controversial method known as hydrological fracturing, or “fracking,” which usually involves the injection of toxic liquids to fracture deep coal seams to release the gas.

The Tahltan started out divided against themselves about it. Then there were road blockades. Tahltan elders were arrested on the blockades. Legal challenges were fought all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada. It was a mess. It didn’t help Shell that company officials had no answers when anyone asked what the implications for the salmon might be. A wave of opposition arose—Friends of the Earth, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Pembina Institute, the David Suzuki Foundation, the Sierra Club, and so on.

Then Shell had the misfortune of finding that the Sacred Headwaters were especially sacred to Wade Davis, the world-famous National Geographic explorer-in-residence who had come to his vocation in those mountains. Among Shell’s fiercest adversaries was a coalition of the Skeena Country’s commercial, recreational, and aboriginal fishing organizations, almost all the First Nations of the area, the local guide-outfitters, the Skeena–Queen Charlotte Regional District, the Kitimat-Stikine Regional District, and the Village of Hazelton.

Even worse for Shell, as things turned out, there was Shannon McPhail, editor of the Kispiox Valley Community Newspaper, circulation: fifty. “A gossip rag,” McPhail calls it proudly. McPhail is a big-voiced, big-hearted, fourth-generation Kispiox Valley jane-of-all-trades with two small kids and a husband who works as a high-pressure welder, two weeks in, two weeks out, in the tar sands of Fort McMurray. She grew up one of four kids in a log house her parents built with trees they cut from their own homestead below Sedina Mountain, just a few kilometers south of the old family place at Telegraph Ranch on the Kispiox River. She was raised on mountain goat meat and wild sheep meat and moose meat, and she didn’t exactly “travel in the same circles” as environmentalists.
![Shannon McPhail: "I didn’t believe that corporations and governments would ever make such terrible decisions." Photo by Gary Fiegehen]({{ ASSET_PATH }}skeena/img/Glavin/Shannon-McPhail20120801_031.jpg)
When McPhail first heard about Shell Energy moving into the headwaters back in 2004, she was twenty-nine, job hungry, and favorably disposed to whatever the company was up to. She had no time for the conservationists in Smithers and Terrace who were raising alarms about what coal-bed methane drilling might mean for the salmon. “I said, ‘You dirty, rotten, dope-sucking, tree-hugging hippies. This is another Chicken Little case of the sky is falling. Well, the sky has been falling, according to you guys, for the last hundred years, and lookit, it’s still up there.’ ” When McPhail first got “active” on the Shell file, it was “to actually shut up all the naysayers,” as she put it. She ended up as the executive director of the Hazelton-based Skeena Watershed Conservation Coalition, the fiercest frontline outfit fighting against Shell.

McPhail’s turnaround involved a sharp and painful learning curve. First, she learned that Shell hadn’t talked to any of the locals and wasn’t even offering the locals any jobs. The more she learned about the project, the harder it was to support it. The more questions she asked about it, the less she liked. Surely there would be a proper environmental assessment before Shell started drilling thousands of gas wells? No. Had anything like this been done before in a wild salmon environment? No. Where would the pipelines go? They didn’t know. Had there been any cumulative impact mapping? No.

“I sat there, and my whole foundation, like, everything that my life had been built on, as far as thinking that everything was okay, just got shattered. Because I didn’t believe that corporations and governments would ever make such terrible decisions and that they always had people’s best interests at heart,” she says.

The Regional District didn’t even know that Shell was already drilling test wells. The provincial Energy and Mines ministry was supposed to be overseeing everything, but the ministry had no answers either. The federal Fisheries and Oceans department insisted there was nothing to worry about—there weren’t even any salmon up there. But the Tahltan elders said there were. Ancient gaff hooks had been found up there.

“I was totally naïve,” McPhail remembers. “I had no idea how conservation or environmental campaigns worked. But I knew that once the people of the community knew what I knew, they would not stand for this. Like, you know, once people got the information that I had, they’d be just as pissed as I was.”

Soon McPhail’s group got involved in a joint project with the Tahltan elders. The main thing they set out to show was that there were indeed salmon up there in the red goat country. By the summer of 2006, they had their evidence: salmon scales collected, spawning fish photographed. Chinook, coho, and steelhead. “Nobody knows what happens in the upper Skeena, right?” McPhail laughs at the memory of that day. The salmon had beaten the odds and changed the nature of the game.

But it was a small victory; the Medeek had not been driven back into the depths of Seeley Lake. Not by a long shot.

*IV. Suddenly, Speaking with the Same Voice*

By the summer of 2012, work had already begun on the massive Red Chris mine, a huge open-pit copper and gold mine covering several thousand hectares of the Todagin Plateau in the Sacred Headwaters territory. Imperial Metals was investing $500 million in the project, an amount matched by provincial and federal contributions of another $500 million in funding for the Northwest Transmission Line, a hydro line that was expected to serve Red Chris and also open up the region to the potential of several more megaprojects. Todagin Mountain is home to the world’s largest concentration of Stone sheep, a distinct genetic variant of wild sheep most closely related to the Snow sheep of Siberia. Imperial Metals was expecting to employ at least two hundred workers to remove 30,000 tons of metal a day for twenty-eight years, starting in 2014.

The edge of the Red Chris pit lay just 20 kilometers from the Tahltan village of Iskut, a community divided against itself over the project along lines similar to the divisions that had initially wracked the Tahltans of Telegraph Creek, on the Stikine River, over the Shell megaproject. Nearby, Fortune Minerals was planning to turn Mount Klappan itself into an open-pit coal mine. Fortune was planning to take up to three million tons of coal every year from a 15,000-hectare lease, an area larger than the city of Vancouver. 

Elsewhere, Avanti Mining Inc. had pumped $70 million into its effort to reopen a molybdenum mine at the ghost town of Kitsault on Alice Arm, north of the Nass River. South of Telegraph Creek, Copper Fox Metals was planning a molybdenum, copper, silver, and gold mine that would directly employ 800 workers. NovaGold’s copper-gold Galore Creek Mine, in a roadless area 150 kilometers northeast of Stewart, was well on its way to hiring about 1,000 construction workers to get the mine up and running. Galore expected it would need 500 workers to run the mine, which could have a life of at least twenty years.

Down in Kitimat, Rio Tinto Alcan was pouring $3.3 billion into its massive aluminum smelter to boost production from 280,000 to more than 400,000 tons per year. Then there was Kitimat Clean Ltd. and its out-of-left-field $13 billion refinery proposal to refine the bitumen Enbridge intended to pump to Kitimat from Bruderheim, Alberta.

That’s not to mention all the natural gas projects. Kitimat LNG was roaring ahead with a $6 billion plan to export 200 million tons of liquefied natural gas per year from a massive LNG plant and terminal it was hoping to begin building at Kitimat and nearby Bish Cove. The Douglas Channel Energy Partnership was planning a smaller plant and terminal nearby, just south of Moon Bay. A Shell Canada joint venture with PetroChina, Mitsubishi, and the Korea Gas Corporation had its eyes on another LNG plant and marine terminal in Douglas Channel, and that one project came with a promise of 5,000 construction jobs for five years. Then there were all the pipelines and tankers that would be required to carry all that natural gas from the gas-producing areas of BC and Alberta and then to markets offshore.

That’s before we even get to the implications of the Enbridge Inc. double pipeline carrying condensates eastward and diluted bitumen westward across as many as 1,000 salmon rivers and creeks, and the 200-plus giant oil tankers that would result every year. The politics of it all were just as confounding in the Skeena Country’s settler communities as in the aboriginal communities. But it was different from the logging-versus-wilderness battles of the past. The lines weren’t forming up so predictably, with “Indians” and “environmentalists” on one side and “rednecks” and backhoe-operator politicians on the other. Something different was happening.

“In a meeting, you would have people who normally couldn’t sit in the same room with each other suddenly speaking with the same voice,” says Bulkley Valley settler Monty Basset. Bassett, sixty-five, is not much like Shannon McPhail. He’s not quite the dope-sucking tree-hugger McPhail used to rail about, but Bassett came into the country as a hippie back-to-the-lander from Wyoming during the Vietnam era. He ran cattle, raised hay, and eventually raised five daughters on the Telkwa High Road above Smithers.

“It’s universal up here, because the one thing that’s going to carry through from Shell to Enbridge, it’s water. It’s not only the lifeblood of our systems and our cultures and all, it’s the lifeblood of everything.” It’s how it came to pass that so many diverse voices came together in the uproars over Shell’s coal-bed methane plans. The same thing blossomed in response to Enbridge.

It’s how it came to pass that Smithers, the largely resource-dependent community of 6000 people, ended up pretty well united against Enbridge (a municipal council resolution formally opposed the project) despite its promise of thousands of construction jobs. The old divisions had broken down so much that by November 2011, Smithers’ voters had elected Taylor Bachrach, a thirty-two-year-old former communications director with the Sierra Club of BC, as their mayor. He had a five-year-old and a three-year-old. He was part of a wave of young people who had been moving to Smithers not just for the work but because of where it is, and what it was becoming. “When you have a bunch of people who want to be together in place,” Bachrach told me, “you have a categorically different conversation than when you move to a place temporarily because that’s where the job is.”

This wasn’t antidevelopment rhetoric. There’s a deep desire for industrial development and jobs around Smithers. But what kind of development? “We need to make sure, as a community and as a region, that we stick together and we take care of each other, and we come out the other end stronger than we were when we went into it,” Bachrach said.

*V. The People of the Cane*

The Great Bear Rainforest is a labyrinthine convulsion of archipelagoes, inlets, and steep-walled, mist-occluded rainforest valleys from Cape Caution at Vancouver Island’s northern tip through the lower Skeena to the Alaskan panhandle. The “Great Bear” in the name of the region is the creature known as a “spirit bear” in the English language. It’s the same ghostly being some Tsimshian people understood to be an animal with the power to vanish from its form as a bear and then reappear transformed into a man. It is a subspecies of black bear, *Ursus americanus kermodei*, famous for the genetic eccentricity that gives it occasionally such oddly pale colors that it can manifest as almost completely white. Modern science has proved that the bears do become invisible, in a sense, to salmon: their success rate in catching salmon in shallow streams, in daylight hours, is perhaps 30 percent greater than that of their black-cloaked cousins.
![A stuffed kermode bear in the Terrace airport. Photo by Gary Fiegehen.]({{ ASSET_PATH }}skeena/img/Glavin/Roche-de-Boise20120801_035.jpg)
But the place that people from away have chosen to imagine as the primeval Great Bear Rainforest wilderness, and that the Canadian government agreed to raise protections for in 2009, once lay within the most densely populated culture area north of the Valley of Mexico and west of the Great Lakes. With human settlements going back 9,000 years, the Great Bear Rainforest is one of the oldest areas of human habitation in North America. People were fishing here long before the ancestors of the pyramid builders were skiffing around in reed boats at the mouth of the Nile River, and until only recently the Great Bear Rainforest was alive with a crashing and a clanking and a whirring at the zenith of the industrial revolution.

The Union Steamship Company once boasted twenty regular ports of call in the Great Bear Rainforest. As the Age of Steam gave rise to the Oil Age, the region was called the Jungles, and generations of loggers and sawmill workers lived and toiled in it and took out the biggest and best and most easily felled timber until the rest was barely worth the bother.

It should also be remembered that there were once more than eighty cannery towns between the Kwagiulth waters around Cape Caution and the Nass River, near the ancient Nisga’a town of Gingolx. Aboriginal workers formed the central division of a cosmopolitan Great Bear Rainforest proletariat that brought in Japanese immigrants, Chinese immigrants, Hawaiians, Orkney Islanders, Englishmen, Americans, Finns, and on and on. The industrial revolution clanked and whirred away, devouring whatever it could refine and process and merchandise. Entire cultures went into its gaping maw and came out the other side forever changed.
![A Gitanow pole. Photo by Gary Fiegehen.]({{ ASSET_PATH }}skeena/img/Glavin/Gitanow20120718_030.jpg)
For the Gitga’at people of the Tsimshian community of Hartley Bay, the initiation into this new world occurred in a utopian New Jerusalem of about 1,100 Tsimshians at Metlakatla, after the name of the Tsimshian village that had been there on Pike Island, at what is now the northern entrance to Prince Rupert Harbour, from time out of mind. Its cavernous Anglican church was the largest church west of Chicago and north of San Francisco. Its streets lit with gas lamps to brighten the twilight gloom, Metlakatla boasted a sawmill, a printing press, a cannery, a textile factory, and merry-go-rounds for the children. By the late 1860s, Metlakatla’s primly uniformed Tsimshian police were patrolling the inlets for rum runners. Its brass band entertained visiting dignitaries. Its choir, renowned for its renditions of Handel’s *Messiah*, occasionally toured the United States.

The Holy City of Metlakatla was established at a time of apocalyptic upheaval, smallpox, spiritual malaise, and cultural collapse among the Tsimshians. Founded by the slightly mad English missionary William Duncan, Metlakatla came to an abrupt demise brought on by the provincial authorities’ nervousness about the community’s power and the Anglican church authorities’ absurd doctrinal disputes with Duncan. In 1887, almost the entire community set off in canoes and small sailboats to establish New Metlakatla in Alaska. By then, there wasn’t much left of the Gitga’at people, one of a dozen Tsimshian communities that had been swept up in Duncan’s utopian fervors.

 When Duncan and his followers left for Alaska, the Gitga’at returned to their home waters in the islands around the mouth of Douglas Channel, but by then there were only twenty-seven Gitga’at left to start anew. Instead of settling back down at the old village of Laxgal’tsap near the Quaal River, they chose a cove a few kilometers away, better protected from the winds, at Hartley Bay. About two hundred people live there now, out of a band membership of roughly seven hundred. It’s a pleasant place, distinctively riven with a network of boardwalks that lead from the dock to all the houses in the village.
![The village of Hartley Bay, home to the "People of the Cane." Photo by Gary Fiegehen.]({{ ASSET_PATH }}skeena/img/Glavin/Hartley-Bay20120708_006.jpg)
While much of the story of Metlakatla has been disremembered in the salal and skunk cabbage of those strange times in the late nineteenth century, it is the memory of a much older city that lives on in the meaning of the name the Gitga’at give themselves: the People of the Cane. It is an antique translation into English that refers to the “canes,” or poles, by which the people once navigated their canoes. It’s a river-canoe method, for shallow water. It comes from the time the people lived up the Skeena River, at Dimlahamid.

During a visit with her in the summer of 2012, the eight-six-year-old Hartley Bay matriarch Helen Clifton wouldn’t venture a guess as to how long ago that was. Clifton, from the Killer Whale clan, said she reckoned it was definitely thousands of years ago anyway. The memory of it persists in the way that the Gitga’at will present their killer whale crest, in blankets and on carved posts, with a fireweed plant coming from the killer whale’s blowhole. The fireweed harks back to their origins in Dimlahamid and also signifies the persistence of a close affinity that binds the Gitga’at Killer Whale clan with the Gitxsan Fireweed clan.   
![Helen Clifton, Gitga'at matriarch: "Everything we have comes from the sea." Photo by Gary Fiegehen.]({{ ASSET_PATH }}skeena/img/Glavin/Helen-Clifton20120709_033.jpg)
In Hartley Bay, there is little nuance on the subject of Enbridge. The project would mean more than two hundred oil tankers coming out of nearby Douglas Channel every year, each oil tanker the size of the Empire State Building in New York. For the Gitga’at, there is nothing to discuss. The only answer is no. It doesn’t take long to understand why. Spend a few minutes at the Hartley Bay dock, and you notice people coming and going in small skiffs and old fishing boats, heading out to set crab traps or coming back with halibut or salmon. First and foremost, it’s about food. It’s simple. “Everything that we have comes from the sea,” Clifton told me. It’s about innumerable and unquantifiable economic, social, cultural factors. It’s about the “spirit bears” too. “Who’s going to speak for them?” It’s certainly not just about the Gitga’at people: “It’s our white brothers and sisters that live in British Columbia, that live along this coast. And they love this coast. They’re no different than we are. They love it the same as we do.”

It’s a story about the fur trade, the rise and fall of the salmon canneries, the highways, the railway, the collapse of the forest industry. Until only recently, the Gitga’at had managed to adapt to the vast transformations wrought by colonial settlement, and rarely was anyone without work and wages. Even after the salmon canneries shut down, the Gitga’at could rely for sustenance, as they always had, on the bounty of the sea. In Hartley Bay, Enbridge was seen as a direct threat to everything that remained.

The anxiety and the dread in Hartley Bay were not just about the threat of a catastrophic bitumen spill. They were about the disruptions and hazards those huge oil tankers would cause in local waters. What about everybody’s crab traps? What about ship wake? Where would anyone set their halibut lines? Even if the Enbridge project got stopped in its tracks, when you added up all the production from the proposed liquefied natural gas plants, you got 1,000 tankers a year coming out of Douglas Channel. Accidents happen. On March 22, 2006, in the middle of the night, the BC Ferries ship *Queen of the North* ran aground and sank at Gil Island with a hundred and one passengers on board. All but two passengers were rescued, and it was the people of Hartley Bay, in their small boats, who were first on the scene. The eventual verdict was “human error.” Humans make mistakes.

“Everybody’s going to have to alter their life course around the tankers,” thirty-one-year-old Hartley Bay guardian-watchman Mathew Danes told me. “We’re going to have to stop harvesting food. Our seaweed camp is right close to the area. Our seaweed camp is right close to the potential tanker route. There’s really nothing we could do. . . .

 “These whales can’t say no. All the creatures in this land can’t say no. We’ve got to kind of protect that. We’ve got to say no for them.”

*VI. Back Upstream*

>The banks of the Babine River have a lovely appearance at this place and a most wonderful sight met our eyes when we beheld the immense array of dried salmon. On either side, there were no less than 16 houses 30 x 27 x 8 feet filled with salmon from the top down so low that one had to stoop to get into them and also an immense quantity of racks, filled up outside. If the latter had stood close together they would have covered acres and acres of ground, and though it was impossible to form an estimate, we judged it to be nearly three quarters of a million fish at those two barricades . . . though the whole tribe had been working together for six weeks and a half it was a wonder that so much salmon could be massed together in that time. 

That’s from Dominion Fisheries officer Hans Helgeson’s journal notes from his 1905 reconnaissance on the Upper Skeena watershed. He was on an assignment for the coastal fishing companies, although officially dispatched by Ottawa, with orders to dismantle the ancient upriver tribal fisheries. His job was to clear them away so that all the clanking and whirring of the coastal canneries could take their place. The work took a few years and no small amount of dynamite, but eventually you could wander such ancient fishing towns as Kisgegas on the Upper Skeena and you would think you were in untouched wilderness. You couldn’t even tell where the graves were. You could walk the bright streets of Prince Rupert and marvel at the ingenuity of an industry, built as though out of nothing.

For the first seven decades of the twentieth century, thousands of gillnetters, trollers, and seine boats roamed the coast, through bumper runs and collapses and from peak years to vanishings. The fishing effort for Skeena salmon centered almost entirely on mixed-stock net fisheries at the river mouth and the saltwater approach areas. The Skeena’s sockeye abundances continued in a long and slow decline, until by the early 1960s the catch was down to a third of what it had been when the century began. In response, the coastal fishing companies convinced the federal Fisheries Department to apply the worst and most costly remedy: a massive enhancement project in the construction of artificial spawning channels at the Pinkut and Fulton Rivers, far upstream, at Babine Lake.

It seemed like such a good idea at the time. The catch data showed a turnaround—a clear incline in Skeena sockeye landings—but the Skeena’s commercial salmon fisheries were by then wholly unsustainable. They were mixed-stock fisheries almost wholly reliant on the sockeye spawning channels at the Fulton and the Pinkut. The Skeena’s prized steelhead runs, most of the Skeena’s thirty distinct and wholly wild sockeye populations, and the Skeena’s coho runs were getting ground up in the gears. All those ancient salmon runs were flickering out like stars in some distant galaxy, one after the other.

For years, everyone in fishing was at everyone else’s throats—the aboriginal fishermen, the sports fishermen, the commercial fishermen. Ottawa tried to manage the fallout with hundreds of millions of dollars sunk into fleet restructuring plans and fishboat buyback schemes, but it was too late. The advance of aboriginal fishing rights cases, the sudden ubiquity of farmed salmon on world markets, a Canadian public that had lost its patience with unsustainable fishing practices—the antiquated coastal salmon-fishery edifice was simply collapsing under the weight of its own absurdities.

“A lot of people don’t understand how emotional and sometimes how vicious it was,” says Bruce Hill. He would know. A veteran of pretty well every major environmentalist battle in the Skeena Country over the past thirty years or so, he’s had an eagle-eye view of the struggles it took to bring the Skeena’s salmon runs back from the brink. He came into the country from the United States, mostly Michigan by way of Southern California, during the same northward hippie migration that brought Monty Bassett to the Bulkley Valley. He raised two kids with his wife, Anne, as a logger, small sawmill operator, and homesteader in the eastern reaches of the Wet’suwet’en territory. He came into his stride as a steelhead guide based mostly out of Terrace, quickly emerged as the loudest noise coming out of the Steelhead Society, and by the early 1990s was heading up its Wild Steelhead Campaign, which was at the leading edge of the salmon wars that so transformed the Skeena fisheries.

By the beginning of the twenty-first century, something almost unimaginably heartening was under way in the Skeena Country. The salmon and the steelhead were all doing more or less pretty well—or at least the drastic declines had been reversed, and some runs were showing signs of recovery and stability. And up where Hans Helgeson had found such immense volumes of salmon being trundled into smokehouses on the Babine River in 1905, the “wonderful sight” he beheld could be seen once again. Near the Babine people’s old mother village of Wu’dat, at the site of the great *k’oonze*, the fish weir that Helgeson described in his journal, the place was a hive of activity. The old wooden-stake weirs were gone but only to make way for steel and aluminum. By 2011, the Skeena’s upriver salmon fisheries were home to the second largest commercial sockeye fishery on Canada’s west coast.

The *k’oonze* was one of a series of aboriginal upriver fisheries that were breathing life back into the ancient practice of live-capture, stock-selective, species-selective salmon fishing. Fueled by court decisions that began, in the 1990s, to assert the aboriginal right to fish, the fishing effort had been slowly shifting back upriver to where it had been for all those millennia.

“You got to watch out for the bears though,” said Quentin William, a nineteen-year-old from Fort Babine who showed me around Wu’dat. The upriver-migrating salmon corral themselves in a series of cage-like structures at the Babine Fence, where they can be counted and harvested by dipnets. The rest—Chinook, steelhead, coho, and pink salmon, and the occasional chum or Dolly Varden—can be released by simply opening a cage door. As for the bears: “They tend to break into the smokehouses and take what they need,” William laughed.

One of about twenty people from nearby Fort Babine on the fence crew the day we visited, William was working eleven-hour shifts at $17 an hour, pushing bin trolleys, 150 fish a trolley. He liked his work, a lot, and it was good and hard work. The crew was pulling about 7,000 sockeye a day to be loaded into totes and trucked to Prince Rupert. A separate crew was running fish back to the smokehouses at Fort Babine.

By the end of the 2012 season, the Skeena’s marine fisheries—the conventional commercial salmon fisheries at the Skeena mouth and in the approach areas—caught 507,022 sockeye. The “inland,” upriver, aboriginal commercial catch accounted for another 329,541 sockeye. The new regime was giving the lie to the arguments against reviving the upriver fishery, arguments that were of a piece with the old fallacy that it’s either jobs or the environment, industry or nature, that there would have to be a trade-off between the fishery’s economic viability on the one hand and biological diversity on the other.

The Skeena’s coho, Chinook, steelhead, and small sockeye runs were benefiting enormously from scaling back the mixed-stock marine fisheries. No surprise there. But the economics of the upriver fishery revival were especially interesting. Against decades of argument, the upriver salmon were not commercially “worthless” after all. On the Bulkley River, the Wet’suwet’en dipnet fishery was earning higher returns on smoked pink salmon than coastal fishermen were getting for pink salmon sold for canned product. The upriver-caught sockeye did lose some value; in 2012, while 39 percent of the Skeena’s commercial sockeye catch was taken in the upriver fisheries, the value of the catch came in at only 26 percent, or $1.9 million. But the capital costs of the upriver fisheries are a fraction of the costs of maintaining a saltwater fishboat fleet, and the wealth spreads itself around more equitably.

Most of sockeye caught in the 2012 “fishboat fishery” around the Skeena mouth were scooped up during a single week of seine fishing and three gillnet-boat openings involving about 350 gillnetters. The upriver fisheries operated for nearly two months, supplying fresh fish to North American markets all that time, and the earnings went to First Nations communities with few economic options available to them.

The Skeena’s main upriver fisheries were the Gitxsan “midriver” beach seine fisheries, the dipnet fisheries at Kisgegas on the Upper Skeena and at Moricetown on the Bulkley, the Babine Fence fishery, and beach seine fisheries in Babine Lake. In the Babine fisheries, roughly eighty local aboriginal people were employed through the summer in a fishery that returned $1.4 million in wages and profits. In the Gitxsan fishery, which took in only about a quarter of sockeye caught in the Skeena’s upriver fisheries in 2012, roughly $460,000 was spread among eleven crews, with an average of seven people per crew.

Most of the midriver fish were going to the Canadian Fishing Company for processing in Prince Rupert, while the Lake Babine Nation had made arrangements with Canfisco and with Raincoast Trading in Delta, on the Fraser River, for the fresh, canned, and frozen market. And this is where the economics gets really interesting.

People will pay a premium to know that the fish they’re buying do not come from a clanking old fishery that’s mining the remnants of the planet’s marine life. Raincoast Trading specializes in sustainably caught fish, marketing a line of salmon, tuna, and sardine products that has earned accolades from Greenpeace and won the backing of the Vancouver Aquarium’s consumer-education Ocean Wise program. In Terrace, meanwhile, the American retail clothing and outdoor-equipment giant Patagonia teamed up with local investors to establish River Wild, a small, state-of-the-art processing plant in 2011. River Wild produces high-end salmon jerky and smoked salmon, sourcing their supply from only sustainable and selectively harvested fisheries like the Babine fishery and the Gitanyow fishery at Meziadin, on the Nass River.

In the middle it all was Greg Taylor, a former fishing-industry executive who started out when he was twenty-five at the old Cassiar Cannery at the mouth of the Skeena—established 1903—and went on to serve as a key architect of the new world arising from the old-time industry’s ashes. Cassiar was the last of the grandpappy canneries to shut down, in the 1980s. By then, Taylor was working as the chief buyer for Ocean Fisheries, a major coastal player, and for a time he was also president of the Northern Processors Association. Taylor was one of the few who could see the writing on the wall. “I was the first guy ever to buy in-river commercial fish, in 1994,” Taylor remembers proudly. “You can imagine what a pariah I was.” The way Taylor put it to me one night over a beer in Smithers, rebuilding the industry from the pilings up wasn’t just commercially smart. It was morally necessary. “The way I saw it, we could promote conservation, and we could rectify an evil. We could actually advance a new and more thoughtful approach to managing salmon in the Skeena system. That’s why I stayed involved,” he said.

Taylor reckons the future is in the kind of fishery that unfolded on the Babine River and along the shores of Lake Babine in 2012. “What the Lake Babine Nation is doing is not just extractive. They’re building capacity to have a whole operation that handles harvesting, processing, and marketing. The vision is they’ll have their own fishing company that not only turns a profit, but successfully brands its own product.”

*VII. “Things Can Be Done Differently”*

In the Nass Valley is a broad volcanic plain that is unlike any landscape in Canada. In the Nisga’a account, it was formed as a consequence of an apocalyptic battle brought against humans by animals. Molten fire burst from the mouth of a volcano to avenge the tormenting of a salmon by a group of young boys, and the lava flows were stopped only by the intervention of a great-beaked supernatural being. The eruption happens to mark the very moment in time that Europeans first came within sight of the Upper Nass Valley. It was in the month of August 1775, aboard the Spanish ship *Sonora*, roughly one hundred kilometers to the west of the Nass mouth, at 55 degrees 17 minutes north. Captain Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra made note of the spectacle. His crewmen “suffered from the heat” of the event, which “lit up the whole district, rendering everything visible.”

It’s a rare occasion for such apparently unconnected forces of nature and human history to collide with such drama. But as the twenty-first century ticked over into its second decade, once again not even the uplands and coastal forests of the Skeena were safe—not with the threat of massive tankers, filled with bitumen, rolling down Douglas Channel and running aground on reefs. Place-names like Kitamaat, Burns Lake, Two Mile, and Telkwa were suddenly mentioned in the same breath as Beijing and Ottawa. The Skeena watershed suddenly sat in the middle of everything, at the vortex of world-devouring convulsions. Terrifying things will sometimes appear on the horizon as though straight out of ancient nightmares. All of a sudden your immediate surroundings have become part of a new and wholly strange cartography. 
![Jason Loring, participating in the Gitxsan's beach-seine fishery, says outsiders miss the totality of salmon's value. “To them, it’s a dollar value. To us it’s about food.”]({{ ASSET_PATH }}skeena/img/Glavin/Jason-Loring20120807_089.jpg)
But locals had found a new voice is this epic struggle. That deep, old connection to this place was sustaining them, allying them, unexpectedly, in the fight of their lives. 

“If we fought bitterly with each other,” says Bruce Hill, referring to salmon wars past, “when it comes to protecting the overall interest of salmon and wild salmon in this watershed, we come together quite effectively and stand shoulder to shoulder to protect salmon habitat in the long term.”

For his daughter, Julia, a conservationist who’s supporting campaigns throughout the watershed, it’s not about saying “no” to development. It’s about slowing down a bit, making careful decisions, and taking care to develop natural resources in ways that don’t require the sacrifice of the Skeena Country’s values. The key is ensuring that salmon and people can co-exist in healthy ways. It’s not terribly complicated. There are fewer than 100,000 people in the region, and they’re all still connected to the salmon in one way or another. “Whether it’s direct or indirect, we’re all connected to that, and that’s incredibly unique,” she says. “So we have a unique opportunity. We haven’t fucked it all up yet, entirely. So we are in a place to show the rest of the world that things can be done differently.”

In the Sacred Headwaters, the pressure of those usual alliances produced a measure of hope in late 2012. After a long series of reviews and moratoriums, Shell agreed to forgo all development rights in the region. Even more astonishing, the anticipated victory of B.C.’s anti-Enbridge opposition New Democrats failed to materialize in the May 14, 2013 provincial election. Even so, two weeks after her incumbent Liberal Party pulled off its historic upset, B.C. Premier Christy Clark made it plain that there was no way that Enbridge Inc. was going to get her government’s support, after all. The B.C. government’s requirements for environmental protection had not been met, and so Victoria “cannot support the issuance of a certificate” for the pipeline, Environment Minister Terry Lake declared.

"The BC government has done the right thing by rejecting the Enbridge pipeline for the company's failure to protect the environment," Art Sterritt, Executive Director of the Coastal First Nations, told reporters. "Coastal First Nations are celebrating this victory today by reaffirming our unequivocal opposition to oil tanker traffic on BC's North Coast."

A completely new mind-set was beginning to take hold in the countryside. “When we look at things, we don’t look at the environment for the sake of saving the environment,” says Shannon MacPhail, the fourth-generation Kispiox Valley rancher turned activist. “In any decision, you have to look at community, the environment, and the economy, and they all have equal bearing.

“If you’re going strictly for economy, the communities and the environment pay. All three have to be incorporated.”
