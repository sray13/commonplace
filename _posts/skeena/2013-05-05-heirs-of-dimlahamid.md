In Skeena country, the relationship between land and people goes back eons, to time of the great mythical city at center of the region: Dimlahamid.  Ancient forms of tenure and title radiate outward from Dimlahamid in every direction: rank, name, fishing station, goat-hunting mountain, hillside berry ground, crest. Every cranny and back eddy is accounted for. And settlers are very much becoming part of the tradition, leaving behind their early moniker bestowed by natives: umshewa, or “driftwood.” The Skeena is a wildness tended by people.

Gary Fiegehen has been photographing the BC landscape and working with First Nations for over 35 years and has contributed to numerous magazines, books, and environmental campaigns. His work has also taken him to Russia, China, and the U.S.A. From sweeping aerial shots to detailed images that evoke an inner stillness, Fiegehen’s work reflects the countryside, the wilderness, and the animals and people who inhabit those places. Fiegehen supported the Nisga’a Nation in attaining the first modern day treaty west of the Rockies. His photography is featured in the NISGA’A TREATY GALLERY, a permanent installation in the Royal British Columbia Museum, Victoria, BC. His work is also featured in the Squamish Lil’wat Cultural Centre in Whistler, BC, and represented in the British Museum, London, UK; The National Museum of the American Indian, Washington DC; and appeared in a major exhibition in Canada’s Museum of Civilization, Hull Quebec.
