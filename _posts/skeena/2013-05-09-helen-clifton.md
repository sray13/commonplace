Within killer whale families, the grandmother is considered the head orca. “Because I belong to the killer whale clan (of the Gitga’at), this is one of the best things I ever heard,” says Helen Clifton, wryly. Helen’s home village was at Port Simpson, the people of Laxwalaams. She married Gitga’at hereditary chief John Clifton in 1942 and moved to Hartley Bay where together they raised six children, who gave them twenty grandchildren. John Clifton passed away in 2004. Helen remains an important and outspoken elder in Hartley Bay. 

Helen explains that the Gitga’at people are renowned for red lever seaweed (Porphyra abbottiae) called ła’ask, and traditionally would trade for oolichan, the sought-
after anadromous smelt species, with the Haisla of Kitamaat. Helen points to relationships like these to demonstrate how the land and the sea bind all of the people in northern British Columbia and Skeena Country together. 

Passionate for camp life, and instilling values of gratitude and resourcefulness in the younger generations of her family, Helen has a steely resolve about protecting the natural habitats that her ancestors have lived off for centuries. “The common people have risen up all over the world against governments, against their actions, and against their treatment of the common man,” she says. “As First Nations people, it’s our last fight for the land and territories that we own.”
